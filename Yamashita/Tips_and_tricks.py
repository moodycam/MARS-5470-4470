# Running Code: 
"""
Use the #%% symbol at the beginning of a line to create new cells in the script

To run a single line of code, use: F9

To run a selection of code: 
    1. highlight code you want to run
    2. F9

To run an entire cell, use:
    ctrl+enter (does not go to next cell)
    shift+enter (goes to next cell)

# Changing the color scheme
"""
Can change the color scheme for spyder by: 
    1. Go to Preferences
    2. Syntax coloring
    3. Edit selected
    4. Change to whatever colors you want

"""

# Spyder interface
"""
You can load or save files from any location

Windows can be rearranged and resized depending on personal preferences

To use the built in help, have cursor on a function -> ctrl+I
This brings up the same thing as using the ? at the end of a function except it opens in the help window instead of the console

Can use the variable explorer to view variables including the values they refer to and their type
    You can also clear all variables using the eraser looking thing in the variable explorer and console windows

Can set a working directory which is the place where things are saved using the file explorer and bar on the top of the page

Can look at things that were done in previous sessions by looking at the history log

"""

# Matplotlib
"""
You can use the same function as for Jupyter Notebooks to embed plots in the console:
    %matplotlib inline
Otherwise plots open in a separate window which you can then edit for export
Plots can be exported directly from the console but they cannot be edited
