Using the predator prey system in the previous lecture, test the effect of changing the timestep on the numerical solution. If you make the timestep 10 times longer (bigger steps), does the solution using forward euler method change, and if so how? Is the difference easier to see in the timeseries or phase space plots? What about the RK4? Repeat the exercise making the timestep 10 times smaller.
