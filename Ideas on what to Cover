# Ideas on what Data Analysis and Modeling to Cover

So far, we have focused on basic programming, visualization and input/output. 
For the next few weeks, we will focus on data analysis and modeling.  
I am asking the students for suggestions of what we will cover, and voting on what most people want.

Please identify your ranked top 5 topics from the Things we could do list below 

## Things we are definitely doing:

Differential Equations
•	Predator prey models

Model fitting: 
•	Correlation
•	Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
•	Curve fitting and analysis of fit, AKA regression analysis (linear and non-linear)
•	Akaike weights for determining model fit

## Things we could do:

Model fitting:
•	Logistic regression
- ANOVA/ANCOVA
  
Timeseries analysis:
•	Fourier Transforms
•	Filtering
  
Spatio-temporal decomposition:
•	EOFS/PCA (Empirical orthogonal functions, principal component analysis)
•	K-means clustering
•	Neural networks
